I'm tired of the same line
I heard through every grape vine
Broken records screaming in time
You'll be fine
You'll be fine
People come and pass by
Even though I wished they stay mine
So many broken records scream in my mind
I'll be fine

I always pushed away
Always pushed away
Scared they'd go away
So I watched them leave
Didn't say nothing
But with you I think it's different

If you ever tell me you gotta go
I'll be the first to ask you where
If you say you need me no more
Then I might have to stop you there
No matter what they say oh you always lit my shadow
I've let love lose all of my battles
But you with you with you with you with you
It's different
I don't know it just is
I don't know it just is
